# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Page Object Model (POM) - Test Automation Framework Structure
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This structure organizes a test automation project to be scalable,
# maintainable, and reusable.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# --- Core Test Directories ---

# testcases/
# This directory contains all the actual test scripts. Each file should
# group related tests (e.g., test_login.py, test_dashboard.py).

#   testdata/
#   This subdirectory stores data used by the tests, such as user credentials,
#   search queries, or expected results. Common formats are JSON, CSV, or Excel files.


# --- Framework Support & Reusable Code ---

# config/
# A directory to hold all configuration-related files.
#
#   driver_config.py or browser_factory.py
#   Manages the setup and configuration of WebDriver instances for different browsers
#   (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
#
#   config.ini or properties.py
#   Stores global settings for the framework, like application URLs, default timeouts,
#   and browser choices.
#
#   environmental_files/
#   (Optional) Holds environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev.json, qa.json, prod.json)
#   to allow tests to run against different environments without code changes.

# pages/
# (This is a key directory for the Page Object Model)
# Contains the Page Object classes. Each class represents a page or a major component
# of the application, encapsulating the web elements and the methods to interact with them.

# utilities/
# A package for all common helper modules and functions.
#
#   reusable_functions.py
#   Contains high-level, business-specific reusable actions or workflows that can be
#   used across multiple test cases (e.g., a complete login sequence).
#
#   utility_functions.py
#   Holds generic, low-level helper functions, like reading from Excel/JSON files,
#   taking screenshots, handling waits, or generating random data.


# --- Output Directories ---

# logs/
# Stores detailed log files generated during test execution, which are essential
# for debugging failures.

# reports/
# The destination for test execution reports, often in HTML format, which provide
# a summary of test results.

# screenshots/
# A directory where screenshots are saved, typically captured automatically when
# a test assertion fails.


# --- Project Root Files ---

# requirements.txt
# A standard Python file that lists all project dependencies (e.g., selenium, pytest).
# Allows for easy setup of the project environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# conftest.py
# A special file for the pytest framework. It's used to define fixtures (e.g., browser setup
# and teardown), hooks, and plugins that are shared across all test files.


# --- Example Code Snippet ---

# This is a standard Python library for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
# It's commonly used in test automation to read test data or configuration files.
